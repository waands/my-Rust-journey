# my-Rust-journey
A few small projects I did to learn the basics of the rust syntax while reading the documentation.

I did this for a college project where me and a two other friends had to prepare a 1 hour long presentation about the Rust programming language.

We started this only as a obligation but ended falling in love with this language. Our presentation happend to be 1h 30min long because of how excited we were to talk about Rust.

The presentation is at the "slides" directory with some of the planning I did for the slides I was responsible for
